PCBot is a internet connected printer that helps you with electronics.

You can chat with it and ask to print a breaboard circuit layout or ask for other assistance in building your electronic project.

PCBot is based on Intel Edison hosting a Telegram bot written in python connected to a thermal printer.

Features:

- **Full-scale breadboard paper templates:** put them on top of the breadboard and stick the componets through the paper.
- **Common electronic components and modules pinouts:** you won’t need anymore to bring your laptop next to the solder station or go crazy with multiple datasheet tabs on your browser.
- **Just a print any image:** if you don’t find a component or a breadboard just send an image URL to the PCBot printer.

Share your breadboard template and help us grow the images database!
